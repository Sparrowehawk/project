                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p><b>What's the point of all of this? </b> <br> Here, as an engineering student, I have created a platform to express my creative desires. In my opinion, engineering is a creative field that combines elements of mathematics and more.
                        This website serves as a medium for me to showcase my ideas, projects, and works in progress. It's a testament to my dedication and ambition, as I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and push my limits. This site itself
                        is coding entirely by hand by me, to prove that I can code. However, I am not a frontend developer; therfore, the site isn't as nice compared to one I can make if I used a website builder. I sincerely hope you enjoy exploring this
                        platform and everything it has to offer.</p>

                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Who am I?</b> <br> I am currently a student pursuing a dual degree of electronic engineering as well as computer science at university somewhere in the UK. To quote my lovely head of my course, it's 2/3rds mathematics, 2/3rds
                        electronic engineering and 2/3rds computing. Some people may be wondering, why? Well, it's mainly because I am facsinated by things that move such as the treads of a conveyar belt or the joint of a robotic arm as it moves in a
                        set direction. These marvels of engineering require both a good grasp of coding as well as electronic knowledge, thus my reasoning to pursue this degree.

For soldering, I use the PINECIL Smart Mini Portable Soldering Iron V2 due to the compact size and the fact it can reach upto 400 degrees celcius. If I do ever get a safe space to work on batteries, I would get my hands on a spot welder. If you do wish to contribute to help, feel free to donate below.
