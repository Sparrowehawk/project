            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                So, I got bored one day and had a long ponder, how do keyboards work and why are they so expensive? A decent mechanical keyboard will definitely set you back about £80 or so. So, I went and done the only logical thing, create my own keyboard.
            </p>

        <section class="backrgound_theory">
            <h4>Background theory</h4>
            <p>
                What system to do I need to create a keyboard? Well, majority of the circuity comes down to creating something called a diode matrix; where diodes are used to connect to a micro controller (MCU) to create a matrix for the MCU to figure out. Historically, majority of keyboards had every pin connected to a GPIO (General Pin Input/Output) header that allows for direct control; however, it limited the number of keys available to be used at any one time.    
                <br><br> A diode matrix works by having every row and column head be connected to the MCU instead of each key, which leads to an increase of number of keys to MxN as long as M + N is less than the number of GPIO headers on the MCU where M is number of rows and N is number of columns.

        <section class="design">
            <h4>Design stage</h4>
            <p>
                To make life easier and to eliminate multiple unknown variables, I will be using a Raspberry Pi Pico as my MCU of choice purely due to how cheap they are, £5 per. Because of this, there are only 3 main things to worry about when designing the final product: connection area to the MCU, leads to the grid and the diode matrix itself. To reduce the number of keys (explained later), I've decided to design a numpad to use on my laptop that doesn't currently have one. For the switches, the cheapest ones off amazon would do just fine. Overall, designing and implementing the final product went as a breeze due to the abundance of recourses online mixed with how little can go wrong here.
            </p>

        <section class="costs">
            <h4>Costs</h4>
            <p>
                So, nothing comes cheap, especially not PCB printing from Taiwan. The actual printing cost wasn't bad at about £20; the main cost was shipping. The reason why the final product downsized from a full sized keyboard to a lonely keypad. It doesn't help that adding a Pico meant that there is excess space waste off to the side. Additional costs were just buying SMD diodes and hand solder them myself as I saw no value of spending an extra £15 for the printing facility to do it instead.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="software">
            <h4>Software</h4>
            <p>
                Of course, it's all good having a working circuit and all but as it is, it's a very bad paperweight. For it to work the Pico needs some form of firmware for it to translate the circuitry's input to something Windows can interpret as a keyboard. For that, I used the famous GitHub repository 
                <a href = "https://github.com/zli117/PicoMK">PicoMK</a> which was does all the magic to translate the matrix to actual inputs. After some tinkering of the config (as I had the diode slightly different to standard), the final product was made.
            </p>

        <section class="outro">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                Overall, this project is definitely on the easier side. I can see why the cost in industry is so high but it isn't due to the electronics itself, it's more so the physical aspect behind things: the switches, casing, packaging. 100% a learning experience, next time will be trying to do the same, but with an embedded chip instead.
